The generic multiple inheretence template is constructed with

BPP -b makeMultipleInheretence.bpp

As an example, Mongrel.java.bpp uses this template to make a class that is
a Boolean, String, and Double.  After the template is built, Mongrel.java.bpp
can be processed in the usual way:

BPP Mongrel.java.bpp
